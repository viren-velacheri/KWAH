Koko wants a home is a simple website that makes adopting a dog from the *Austin Animal Center*, easier and faster.
We got this idea when we were adopting our dog Koko. It was difficult to search for dogs on the Austin Animal Center website.
It had very primitive search capabilities.
It was hard to keep track of which dogs we had already seen, which were the new dogs ,without browsing through the entire list.
In this age of smartphones the Austin Animal Center website is not mobile friendly, check out the screenshot below.
